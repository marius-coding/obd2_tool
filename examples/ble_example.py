Example of using BLE connection with Vgate iCar Pro OBD2 adapter.

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Discover OBD2 BLE devices
2. Connect to a Vgate iCar Pro adapter
3. Initialize ELM327 protocol
4. Send commands and read responses

Requirements:
- Vgate iCar Pro or compatible BLE OBD2 adapter
- Adapter must be powered (connected to 12V or car OBD2 port)
- bleak library installed (pip install bleak)
