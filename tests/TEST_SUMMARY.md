- ✅ Parameter validation and configuration
- ✅ Buffer operations (read/write/flush)
- ✅ Timeout handling
- ✅ Notification handler
- ✅ Device discovery (mocked)
- ✅ Error handling for closed connections
- ✅ Data buffering and chunking

### ELM327 Driver Tests (9 tests)
1. **test_initialization** - Verifies proper initialization sequence (ATZ, ATE0, ATL0, ATS0, ATH1, ATSP0)
2. **test_send_uds_message_no_response** - Tests handling of ECU non-response (SEARCHING... with no data)
3. **test_send_uds_message_with_isotp_response** - Tests multi-frame ISO-TP response parsing
4. **test_send_uds_message_single_frame** - Tests single-frame ISO-TP response
5. **test_parse_multiframe_response** - Verifies consecutive frame handling
6. **test_invalid_response_handling** - Tests exception handling for malformed responses
7. **test_tester_present_enable_disable** - Tests cyclic tester present functionality

### MockSerial Tests (2 tests)
1. **test_mock_initialization_sequence** - Verifies mock returns correct initialization responses
2. **test_mock_uds_responses** - Verifies mock returns correct UDS command responses

## Test Data Source
All test responses are based on the recorded ELM327 communication trace from 15:17:45 - 15:17:55.

## Key Features Tested
- ✅ Automatic device detection
- ✅ Initialization sequence
- ✅ UDS message transmission
- ✅ ISO-TP multi-frame reassembly
- ✅ Error handling and custom exceptions
- ✅ Cyclic tester present
- ✅ Response parsing with "SEARCHING..." text
- ✅ CAN frame parsing (3-char ID + 16-char data)

## Running the Tests

### All Tests
